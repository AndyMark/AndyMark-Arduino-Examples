//Some light chase hacks for the AM-2640 5V, Addressable LED strips http://www.andymark.com/product-p/am-2640.htm based on the WS2801 chipset
//We ran this demo off of our AM-2287 Arduino Ethernet http://www.andymark.com/product-p/am-2287.htm
//http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEthernet
//The FastLED library we use here supports multiple chipsets
//This code requires that the fastspi library be put in your arduino\libraries folder

//***NOTE: This strip runs off of 5V MAX!!!.  Applying more than 5V will damage/destroy you LED strip!***
//DO NOT try to power the whole strip (80 LEDs) off the arduino 5v regulator.
//At full bright white, the strip can draw 1.5Amps or so. This will overheat or burnout the regulator.
//Remember on the AM-2640 LED strip's yellow wire is ground! (don't blame us they come that way)
//Make sure you connect the Yellow ground from the LED strip to the Arduino ground.
//Communications to the LEDs requires a common ground to work.

//We recommend running these led strips off of the AM-0899 10-30Vin to 5V 5A out stepdown converter http://www.andymark.com/product-p/am-0899.htm
