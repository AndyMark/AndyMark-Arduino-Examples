AndyMark-Arduino-Examples
=========================

If you are new to working with Arduino a good place to start is here
http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage

This is meant to be a collection of simple Arduino examples to help our customers get started. Code is tested on our Arduino Ethernet modules http://www.andymark.com/product-p/am-2287.htm  Individual examples will be subfolders in this repository.

Go to http://files.andymark.com/AndyMark_AM-2640_LED_setup.pdf for some simple hookup instructions.<br>
Make sure you connect the ground from the LED strip to the Arduino ground.  
Communications to the LEDs requires a common ground to work.

<b>NOTE: Make sure you do not apply more than 5V to these LED strips or you will destroy them!</b>
